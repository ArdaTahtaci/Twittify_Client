On this project I tried to create a social media web app almost same the Twitter as possible as I can.
The UI design is almost same with real Twitter and also the concept.
My goal was improve my React,nodejs,mongoose,expresjs skills and I can happily to say that I accomplished.

Deatils about project: 
-
From here I'm gona try to explain how did I do this project on my own with no help but just the Internet. This explanation is for my job || internship applications (recruitment specialists).

----------------------------------------
I used react-router, redux, axios and bootstrap with some custom css for UI; on backend nodejs with exress and mongoose for mongodb to store tweets and users data. Both frontend and backend I tried to make file configurations properly. To be honest at first I haven't got a project plan. When I started to building, looked at the Twitter and tried to figure out how can I do this and this and this ... Of course there is no complicated algorithm, AI or any searchings; the tweets line up by time that they posted. It took approximately 120-150 hours. I should say that -esspecialy for react- My codes are not well readable and the reason is like I said before I haven't got any project plan so I wrote it spontaneously.

---
If I try to create exactly the same of this project it would be better code structure and readability and it would took shorter time like may be 40 - 50 hours.

Of course you can look at my code from this two repo's and ask me anything about it by sending an email me. Mail -> ardata123@gmail.com
